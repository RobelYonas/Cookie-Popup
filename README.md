# Cookie Policy UI Implementation

This project demonstrates an interactive cookie policy notification using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GSAP animations. It features a dynamically animated cookie icon, text, and buttons for user interaction.

## Features

- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) cookie icon with detailed design.
- Smooth animations for the cookie icon and text, enhancing user engagement.
- Responsive design ensuring proper display across various devices.
- Button to accept the cookie policy, improving user experience and compliance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the cookie policy notification.
- **CSS**: Styling for the cookie policy layout and elements.
- **JavaScript (GSAP)**: Animations for the cookie icon and the accompanying text.

## Setup

To run this project locally, download the files and open `index.html` in a web browser.

### Files

- `index.html`: Contains the markup for the cookie policy notification.
- `style.css`: Styles for the layout and elements.
- `app.js`: JavaScript code using GSAP for animations.

## How It Works

- The cookie icon and text appear with an elastic and fading effect, respectively, creating a pleasant entrance animation.
- The cookie icon performs a subtle bobbing animation to draw attention.
- A button is provided for users to accept the cookie policy, which, upon clicking, triggers a fade-out animation.

## Dependencies

- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For complex animations. Ensure to include GSAP in your project by linking to the CDN in your HTML file or installing it via NPM/Yarn.
